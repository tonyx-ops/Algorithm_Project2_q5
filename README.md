# Algorithm_Project2_q5

Algorithm_Project2_q5 is a Python/Jupyter Notebook project that implements the divide-and-conquer convex hull algorithm (often called MergeHull) and evaluates its runtime growth against the theoretical O(nlogn) bound. The notebook generates random 2D point sets, computes their convex hulls, and produces visualizations of both the geometry (points only and points with the hull overlay) and the performance (a log–log plot of time versus n, and a straight-line plot of time versus nlogn). Together these figures let you verify that the empirical behavior matches the theory while also seeing the hull result on real data.
The code can be implemented by Python 3.9–3.12 and uses NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. You can work entirely in Jupyter by creating a virtual environment, installing the dependencies, and opening the notebook. From there, run all cells to generate datasets, compute hulls, and time the algorithm across multiple input sizes. If you prefer a script workflow, a companion Python file mirrors the notebook’s timing loop and saves a CSV of results plus PNG plots to a local figures/ folder. All random number generators are seeded so that experiments are reproducible across runs and machines.
At a high level the algorithm sorts points by (x,y), recursively computes convex hulls on the left and right halves, and merges them in linear time using rotating-calipers to find the upper and lower tangents before splicing only the outer arcs. The base case for three or fewer points uses a tiny monotone-chain routine. Sorting dominates the asymptotics and each merge is linear, so the overall time complexity is 
If you run into issues, ensure Jupyter is using the correct kernel and that Matplotlib is configured for your environment (inline or widget backends in notebooks, PNG files when running as a script). Very large input sizes may require reducing the number of size list to keep runtimes reasonable.
